Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Session::ExpireSessions.

1.02  Tue Jun 29 10:08:00 2004
	- Add code so sessions which have already expired are also deleted.
		Originally, the module allowed you to force sessions to expire, via the delta parameter to new().
		Now it also checks for sessions which have already expired, that is for sessions which CGI::Session
		would delete automatically when retrieving them. Thanx to Adam Gent for this suggestion
	- Rewrite the POD where it discusses expiration and deletion

1.01  Tue Apr 27 10:01:00 2004
	- Add another parameter to new(): table_name. This allows you to store sessions in a table with
		a non-default name. The default name is of course 'sessions'. Thanx to Mark Stosberg for this
		suggestion
	- This module does not work with Mark's module CGI::Session::PureSQL. The best solution to this
		problem seems to be to extend CGI::Session to offer a session iterator. This suggesion is also
		from Mark. I will propose this today to the author of CGI::Session when I report the bug in
		CGI:Session V 3.94 line 168, which says:
			if ( $arg->isa('CGI') )
		This bug means classes such as CGI::Simple can't be used here as a replacement for CGI.
		The code needs to be something like:
			if ($arg -> can('cookie') )...
			elsif ($arg -> can('param') )...
