Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Session::ExpireSessions.

1.04  Tue Nov 02 15:20:00 2004
	- Note: All files referred to here match the CGI::Session file name format /cgisess_[0-9a-f]{32}/
	- Fix the assumption in sub expire_file_sessions() that the program was being run in the temp directory,
		by adding the temp directory's name as a prefix to all file names.
		Original patch: Matthias Bläsing
	- Fix sub expire_file_sessions() to delete files of size <= 5 bytes which are old enough. Files of size 0
		are sometimes created by CGI::Session under unknown circumstances.
		As always, use new(delta => 123) to change the definition of 'old enough'
	- Fix verbose message for file session where it should have referred to $$D{'_SESSION_ID'}
		and not $$D{'id'}. The latter was a careless copy-and-paste from the database code
	- Ignore recent files whose size is <= 5 bytes
	- Change text of verbose messages from 'Time lapsed' to 'Time elapsed'
	- Add a security warning to the POD. Actually this comment is redundant, because you always read the POD,
		right?

1.03  Mon Jul 19 14:47:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.02  Tue Jun 29 10:08:00 2004
	- Add code so sessions which have already expired are also deleted.
		Originally, the module allowed you to force sessions to expire, via the delta parameter to new().
		Now it also checks for sessions which have already expired, that is for sessions which CGI::Session
		would delete automatically when retrieving them. Thanx to Adam Gent for this suggestion
	- Rewrite the POD where it discusses expiration and deletion

1.01  Tue Apr 27 10:01:00 2004
	- Add another parameter to new(): table_name. This allows you to store sessions in a table with
		a non-default name. The default name is of course 'sessions'. Thanx to Mark Stosberg for this
		suggestion
	- This module does not work with Mark's module CGI::Session::PureSQL. The best solution to this
		problem seems to be to extend CGI::Session to offer a session iterator. This suggesion is also
		from Mark. I will propose this today to the author of CGI::Session when I report the bug in
		CGI:Session V 3.94 line 168, which says:
			if ( $arg->isa('CGI') )
		This bug means classes such as CGI::Simple can't be used here as a replacement for CGI.
		The code needs to be something like:
			if ($arg -> can('cookie') )...
			elsif ($arg -> can('param') )...
